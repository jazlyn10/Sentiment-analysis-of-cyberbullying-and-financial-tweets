# Sentiment-analysis-of-cyberbullying-and-financial-tweets
#Problem Statement 1 : 
The task is to develop a text classification model that can automatically identify potentially harmful tweets and analyze patterns of hatred. The dataset, containing over 47,000 tweets, is labeled based on various classes of cyberbullying, including age, ethnicity, gender, religion, other types of cyberbullying, and non-cyberbullying.

Outcome 2 : LSTM performed the best out of the 3 models when tuned with learning rate of 0.001, and optimser : adam. with accuracy of 0.93 as compared to gru with0.91 and word2vec withnan accuracy of 0.82

Problem Statement 2 :  The financial sentiment analysis to develop a neural network model that can accurately classify the sentiment of financial sentences into positive, negative, or neutral categories. 

Outcome :  LSTM performed the best out of the 2 models when tuned with learning rate of 0.001, and optimser : adam. with accuracy of 0.81 as compared to g word2vec withnan accuracy of 0.5701
